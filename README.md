# Chicks_and_wolves
Solving the chicks and wolves problem using different searching algorithms

The goal of this problem is to get all chicks and wolves to the other side of the river without the wolves eating the chicks. I've implemented the following algorithms to sovle it
  - A* search
  - Breadth first search
  - Depth first search
  - Iterative deepening depth first search

After the user makes a choice on which searching algorithm to use, the program finds a solution with it and outputs the answer to a text document
